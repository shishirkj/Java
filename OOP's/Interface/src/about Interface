AnÂ `interface`is a completely "**abstract class** " that is used to group related methods with empty bodies:

1.Interface - use only methods with empty bodies.

2.Dependency Injection - constructor, setter, method injections.

3.Interface Segregation Principle

// keywords use - implements.

// interfaces used to build loosely coupled, extensible, testable applications.
